# **Project Python - Explore US Bikeshare Data**

## **Project Overview**
In this project, you will write Python code to import US bikeshare data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 
You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## **Project Details**
In this project, you'll write code to provide the following information:
1. Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
    - most common month
    - most common day of week
    - most common hour of day
2. Popular stations and trip
    - most common start station
    - most common end station
    - most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)
3. Trip duration
    - total travel time
    - average travel time
4. User info
    - counts of each user type
    - counts of each gender (only available for Chicago and NYC datasets - see 'The Datasets')
    - earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for Chicago and NYC datasets - see 'The Datasets')

## **The Datasets**
There are three city dataset files:
1. 10_2-chicago.csv
2. 10_2-new_york_city.csv
3. 10_2-washington.csv

All files include randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
1. Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
2. End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
3. Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
4. Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
5. End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
6. User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
1. Gender
2. Birth Year
